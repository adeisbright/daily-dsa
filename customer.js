// Customer comes to the store to buy some products. He can  buy apples ($3), grapes ($5) and peaches ($7).
//Thereâ€™re also 2 types of discounts: 1) If customer buys more than 1 apple, he gets a discount of 20% for all apples; 2) If customer buys one grapes he gets another one for free. Calculate the price of the basket, getting into account data comes into the following format

// following the logic interviewer tried to explain to me, which kept in my memory):

//[["grapes", 1],["apples", 0],["peaches", 1]] => 12
//[["grapes", 1],["apples", 1],["peaches", 1]] => 15
//[["grapes", 1],["apples", 2],["peaches", 1]] => 16.8
//[["grapes", 3],["apples", 1],["peaches", 1]] => 20
// #
